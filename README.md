# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and analyze how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results

From the results shown from the PyBer Summary DataFrame, we noticed that Urban is the most profitable one out of the three city types with the most total rides as well while also having the least amount of average fare per ride and per driver. A possible explanation for these results is that there is more demand for rides at Urban cities, and therefore they can lower the average fares to better satisfy customers. 

Then when we look at the data from suburban cities, they are ranked second across all statistics.

Lastly, Rural is the least profitable one out of the three city types with the least total rides and the most expensive average fare per ride and per driver. An explanation for this is that the average fare per ride in rural cities is too expensive for customers to consider getting rides, and also people who live in rural areas most likely have their own vehicle to commute, thus their demand for rides are the lowest compared to urban and suburban cities.

When we look into the multiple-line chart that shows the weekly total fares by city type, we can see an even clearer comparison between the three city types that shows that urban cities generate significantly much more profit compared to suburban and rural cities.

## Summary
Based on the results, the following are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types

-provide more drivers available at rural areas at lower average fares per ride to entice customers to get rides

-come out with incentives periodically for customers at rural and suburban areas such as getting 20 percent off rides

-lower average fare costs across all three city types during the beginning of each month, as ride demand seems to be the highest during those times
